# Navigating Self-Regulated Learning Dimensions: Exploring Interactions With-in and Across Modalities

This repository contains the supplementary material for the LAK 2024 submission. 

Abstract: Self-regulated learning (SRL) has been extensively studied using self-reported measures, such as surveys, and more recently, behavioral measures, such as trace data. While both modalities offer insights into SRL, their relationship remains ambiguous. Although previous research has compared these modalities, there has been limited work on integrating them and exploring the interplay of dimensions across modalities. To address this gap, we adopt a multimodal perspective and follow a threefold approach: horizontal, vertical, and integrated analyses. In the horizontal analysis, we identify behaviors per dimension and integrate them in multi-dimensional SRL profiles from both data sources. We then assess the alignment of dimensions across modalities in the vertical analysis. Finally, in the integrated analysis, we uncover the intricate interplay between dimensions across modalities using Canonical Correlation Analysis. For this purpose, we design and run a study with $79$ participants who interacted with an Intelligent Tutoring System over a period of $6-10$ weeks. We find limited agreement in vertical comparison between modalities. However, the integrated analysis reveals a moderate correlation, highlighting the complex relationship between behavioral actions and self-reported SRL perceptions.
